# Introduction
Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) positioning techniques has a wide application prospect of autonomous driving, emergency rescue, and medical fields. At present, the main method to solve this challenging problem are to use optical technology to locate the target position in the NLOS environment. However, widespread implementation and adoption of the technology remains a challenge because of the requirement for a stable optical environment, specialized and expensive optical equipment. Here we show a sound source localization method under NLOS environment, which establishes a corresponding sound transmission model, analyzes the reflection of sound waves on the reflection interface, and obtains the 3-dimensional space coordinates of the sound source in the NLOS environment. In the experiment, we built a non-uniform hybrid array of T-shaped and cross-shaped microphones, use the time delay estimation method of this paper to get the time difference between reaching different microphone arrays, construct nonlinear equations, calculate the three-dimensional position of the target sound source. Finally, the experiment proves the effectiveness of the method in this paper.
